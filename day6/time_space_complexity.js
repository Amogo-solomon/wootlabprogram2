// 1. time complexity of a given function that searches for a specific element in an unsorted array.
/* this approach is know as linear search because the functions searches for a targeted element in an unsorted array by iterating through each elememt until it locates the element targeted or reaches the end of the array. */

//WORST CASE TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
/* in this Scenario, to find the target Element, the function needs to traverse the entire array. This happens when the target element is either not present in the array or located at the end of the array. */

// BEST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY: O(1)
/* if the target element is the first element of the arrayReverseFunction, the function finds it in constant time with just one comparison */

// AVERAGE-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY: O(n)
/* in this case, the function may need to search through approximately half of the array elements to find the target element. However, we simplify this to O(n) because we're only interested in the dominant term in the complexity analysis */


// 2. Discuss the potential impact of array size on the function's performance
// The time complexity of the function is directly proportional to the size of the array. As the array size increases, the function may degrade, especially in the worst-case scenario where it needs to traverse the entire array. Larger arrays require more iterations, resulting in longer execution times.

// 3. Estimate the space complexity of the function.
// The space complexity of the function is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of additional space regardless of the size of the input array. the function only requires space to store a few variables such as the target element and loop counters. It doesn't allocate additonal memory based on the size of the array.

// In summary, the fiunction for searching a specific element in an unsorted array has a time complexit of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. The performance of the function may vary based on the size of the array, with larger arrays potentially leading to longer execution times. Hoever, the space complxity remains constant at 0(1), indicating efficinet memor usage
